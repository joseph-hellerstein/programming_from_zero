    "1. **Interview dates vary** - pre-election interviews typically span 6-8 weeks\n",
    "2. **Post-election timing matters** - memory decays, emotions change\n",
    "3. **Campaign dynamics** - early interviews miss late campaign events\n",
    "4. **Mode and timing often confounded** - web interviews may be completed faster\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Geographic Variables:**\n",
    "1. **Boundaries change** - congressional districts redistricted every 10 years\n",
    "2. **Metropolitan definitions evolve** - what counts as \"urban\" has changed\n",
    "3. **Regional coding consistent** - but political meaning of \"South\" has shifted\n",
